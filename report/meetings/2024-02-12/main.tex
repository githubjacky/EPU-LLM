\section{Add Defition Of EPU Into Prompt}


\begin{frame}{Add Definition}
You are building indices of policy-related economic uncertainty based on
\{ country \} newspaper coverage frequency, with the aim to capture
uncertainty about who will make economic policy decisions, what economic policy
actions will be undertaken and when, and the economic effects of policy actions
(or inaction) – including uncertainties related to the economic ramifications
of “non-economic” policy matters, e.g., military actions. \newline

The process of building the index is as follows: \newline
1. Define three sets of keywords, E, P, U, containing keywords
    corresponding to the economy, policy, and uncertainty, respectively.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Add Definition}
2. Given a collection of news articles x, an article is considered related to
    policy-related economic uncertainty if it "meets the following three
    criteria simultaneously": \newline
- Contains a word belonging to the E set \newline
- Contains a word belonging to the P set \newline
- Contains a word belonging to the U set \newline

3. The index is calculated as the number of news articles related to
    policy-related economic uncertainty divided by the total number of news
    articles in x. \newline
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Add Definition}
"You must consider the concept of Word Segmentation and output non-compound
words, but rather simple and common words." \newline

Your task is to "define and list \{n\_items\} keywords in bullet points for
each E, P, U set". \newline

Output Instructions: \newline
1. List in bullet points \newline
2. \{ language\_instrucrions \}

"You must consider the concept of Word Segmentation and output non-compound
words, but rather simple and common words." \newline

Please proceed with the following tasks step by step. \newline

1. "Define and list \{ n\_items \} keywords in bullet points for each E, P, U
    set". \newline

2. Provide an example of a news article, including its title and content,
    which is related to policy-related economic uncertainty. \newline

3. Identify a word from the article in task 2 that belongs to the set
    defined in task 1 as E
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Add Defition with SC}

4. Identify a word from the article in task 2 that belongs to the set
    defined in task 1 as P \newline

5. Identify a word from the article in task 2 that belongs to the set
    defined in task 1 as U \newline

"Warning: The words listed in tasks 3, 4, and 5 must be consistent with those
you defined in task 1; do not list words that you did not define in the
E, P, U sets in task 1." \newline
